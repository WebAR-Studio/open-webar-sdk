## 🚀 Why This Repo Matters

If you're a developer exploring WebAR, you probably struggle with one (or all) of these:

- 😵 WebAR feels complex, with scattered docs and inconsistent examples
- 🔄 Repeating boilerplate setup again and again
- 🧪 You want quick proof-of-concept demos, not a 3-week setup
- 📱 You're tired of native apps—users won’t install them
- 💼 You need to **show results fast** to clients, bosses, or stakeholders

This repo solves that by providing **ready-to-run, production-grade examples** for every major tracking mode supported by [WebAR.Studio](https://web-ar.studio).

Just clone → run → customize → ship.
